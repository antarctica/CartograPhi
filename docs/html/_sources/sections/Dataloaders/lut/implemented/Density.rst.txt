Density Dataloader
******************

Density values were taken from the paper 'Thickness distribution of Antarctic sea ice'
(Worby, A.P. et al.). This paper took a density model from the paper 'Structure, principal 
properties and strength of Antarctic sea ice' (Buynitskiy, V.K.). 

Name in config: :code:`'density'`

Data is generated using the values from this paper, and so no data file is available for download.
