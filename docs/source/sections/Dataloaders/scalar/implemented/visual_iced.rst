Visual_iced Dataloader
*************************

Visual_iced is a dataloader for .tiff images generated from the visual_ice library, 
developed my Martin Rogers at the British Antarctic Survey's AI Lab. The Visual_iced 
images are ice/water binary files, generated from a combination of MODIS and SAR 
satellite imagery. 

In the source data, 0's are representaive of open water, and 1's are representative of 
ice. In the dataloader, we map theses values to Sea ice concentration, in range of 0 to 100.
Values between 0 and 100 are generated by the aggregation of the 0's and 1's within each cell.
