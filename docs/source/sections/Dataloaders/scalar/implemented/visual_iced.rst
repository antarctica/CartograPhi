Visual_iced Dataloader
*************************

Visual_iced is a dataloader for .tiff images, which are outputs from the visual_iced library
developed by Martin Rogers at the British Antarctic Survey's AI Lab. These visual_iced
images are ice/water binary files, generated from a combination of MODIS and SAR
satellite imagery. 

In the source data, 0s are representative of open water, and 1s are representative of
ice. In the dataloader, we map these values to sea ice concentration, in the range of 0 to 100.
Values between 0 and 100 are generated by the aggregation of the 0s and 1s within each cell.

.. note:: 
    The visual_iced dataloader only supports loading in single files, as the visual_iced datasets
    are not temporally continuous within a given boundary.
