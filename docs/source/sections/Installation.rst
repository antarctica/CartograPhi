Installation
************

In this section we outline the necessary steps for installing the MeshiPhi software package. MeshiPhi requires a
pre-existing installation of Python 3.8 or higher.


Installing MeshiPhi
#####################

MeshiPhi can be installed from one of the following two sources:

from PyPI:
::

    pip install MeshiPhi

from Github:
::

    git clone https://github.com/antarctica/MeshiPhi.git
    cd MeshiPhi
    pip install .


Installing GDAL (Optional)
##########################

MeshiPhi has GDAL as an optional requirement. It is only used when exporting TIFF images, so if this is not useful to
you, we would recommend steering clear. It is not trivial and is a common source of problems.
With that said, below are instructions for various operating systems.

Windows
*******

.. note:: 
    We assume a version of Windows 10 or higher, with a working version of Python 3.9 including pip installed. 
    We recommend installing MeshiPhi into a virtual environment.

Windows:

::

    pip install pipwin # pipwin is a package that allows for easy installation of windows binaries
    pipwin install gdal
    pipwin install fiona


Linux/MacOS
***********

Ubuntu/Debian:

::
   
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    pip install GDAL==$(gdal-config --version)


Fedora:

::

    sudo dnf update
    sudo dnf install gdal gdal-devel
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
    pip install GDAL==$(gdal-config --version)


MacOS (with HomeBrew):
